                <h5 class="port-subheadline">Note</h5>
                <p>The DCO (Dynamic Creative Optimization) were in charge of creating mocks for hilton using the 'Tile-look'. The challenge we ran into was making sure that the 'Tile-look' would work across 9 of Hilton's different resort such as Hilton, Waldorf Astoria, Conrad, DoubleTree, Embassy, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton, Homewood Suite and Home2 as well as Hilton HHonors. Hilton wanted a variety of digital advertising with different functions such as timers and carousel. We focused in making sure that images were still crisp and clean and that text were readable across the 4 banner sizes that they wanted. My job for the team was to lead the campaign and make sure information from the Client, the Project Manager and the Creative Director was delegated out to the international design team and to make sure that every changes was done and that the design followed Hilton's brand guidelines. I helped out with the creative aspect, as well as the building process in Flash and made QA changes when needed. When the campaign was launch, I worked mostly with the PM, QA and the Analyst in making sure that the banner look good and that the dynamic text and images weren't overlapping each other.</p>
